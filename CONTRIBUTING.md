# Contributing to React Native Async Storage

Thank you for helping out with Async Storage! We'd like to make contributions as
pleasent as possible, so here's a small guide of how we see it. Happy to hear
your feedback about anything, so please let us know.

## Tests

We use TypeScript for type check, `eslint` with `prettier` for
linting/formatting, `jest/detox` for tests (unit and e2e). All tests are run on
CircleCI for all opened pull requests, but you should use them locally when
making changes.

- `yarn test`: Run all tests, except for e2e (see note below).
- `yarn test:lint`: Run `eslint` check.
- `yarn test:ts`: Run `tsc` type check.
- `yarn test:e2e:<ios|android|macos>`: Runs e2e tests. Before you can run it,
  you should build the app that can be run, by using
  `yarn build:e2e:<ios|android|macos>`.

## Sending a pull request

When you're sending a pull request:

- Communication is a key. If you want fix/add something, please open new/find
  existing issue, so we can discuss it.
- We prefer small pull requests focused on one change, as those are easier to
  test/check.
- Please make sure that all tests are passing on your local machine.
- Please make sure you've run formatters and linters locally.
  - In VS Code, you can press ⇧+Alt+F or ⇧⌥F to format the current file.
    - To format C++ and Objective-C files, make sure you have the
      [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
      installed.
    - To format JavaScript files, please install
      [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
  - From the command line, you can run `yarn format:c` and `yarn format:js` to
    format C-based languages and JavaScript respectively. The first command
    requires that you've already installed
    [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
- Follow the template when opening a PR.

## Commits and versioning

All PRs are squashed into `master` branch and wrapped up in a single commit,
following
[conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3).
Combined with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), this allows us to have
a frequent releases of the library.

_Note_: We don't force this convention on Pull Requests from contributors, but
it's a clean way to see what type of changes are made, so feel free to follow
it.

Most notably prefixes you'll see:

- **fix**: Bug fixes, triggers _patch_ release
- **feat**: New feature implemented, triggers _minor_
- **chore**: Changes that are not affecting end user (CI config changes,
  scripts, ["grunt work"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26944812/3510245))
- **docs**: Documentation changes.
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

## Release process

We use [Semantic Release](http://semantic-release.org) to automatically release
new versions of the library when changes are merged into `master` branch, which
we plan to keep stable. Bug fixes take priority in the release order.

## Reporting issues

You can report issues on our
[bug tracker](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-async-storage/issues).
Please search for existing issues and follow the issue template when opening an
one.
