### Flipper

For projects that use Flipper, there is a Flipper plugin called [Advanced Async Storage](https://github.com/lbaldy/flipper-plugin-async-storage-advanced). The plugin provides basic CRUD operations on Async Storage.


### Non Flipper

For the projects which aren't using Flipper, you can use the [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) which comes with a built-in Async Storage support. The debugger allows to print the Async Storage content to the console, and clear it completely.
