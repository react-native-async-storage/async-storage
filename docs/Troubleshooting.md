# Troubleshooting

## [iOS] CocoaPods issues

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder(s) from your project
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. If you're using CocoaPods:
    1. Make sure your `Podfile` has this entry:
        ```Podfile
        pod 'RNCAsyncStorage', :path => '../node_modules/@react-native-community/async-storage'
        ```
    2. Make sure your `Podfile` does _not_ have an entry for `react-native-async-storage`.
    3. `pod install`
    4. `pod update RNCAsyncStorage`
4. Open your Xcode project
5. Press ⇧⌥⌘K to clean your build folder
6. Build and run your project

> Note that every time `@react-native-community/async-storage` gets updated, you
> must also run `pod update RNCAsyncStorage` otherwise you'll still be using the
> previous version.

## [iOS] fatal error: 'React/RCTBridgeModule.h' file not found

- Make sure that you've run `pod install` or `pod update RNCAsyncStorage` (see
  also [CocoaPods issues](#ios-cocoapods-issues)).

- If you've manually linked React Native, but use CocoaPods for AsyncStorage,
  AsyncStorage will not be able to find React headers. You'll need to set header
  search path, or also consume React Native via CocoaPods.

- Make sure that `React` dependencies are _not_ removed from projects. Without
  the target dependency set, Xcode may build things out of order and the React
  headers will not be installed when AsyncStorage is built.

  ```Podfile
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      if target.name == "React"
        target.remove_from_project
      end
    end
  end
  ```

- Try switching back to the legacy build system in Xcode. You can find it in
  File > Project/Workspace Settings sheet.

## [@RNC/AsyncStorage]: NativeModule: AsyncStorage is null

### iOS

This error means that AsyncStorage was unable to find its native module. This
occurs because AsyncStorage was not linked into the final app bundle.

- Make sure that you've run `pod install` or `pod update RNCAsyncStorage` (see
  also [CocoaPods issues](#ios-cocoapods-issues)).

- If you have an Expo app, AsyncStorage will not work unless you eject the app.
  After ejecting the app, you may have to
  [manually link](Linking.md#project-linking) depending on whether you chose to
  use Expo SDK.
